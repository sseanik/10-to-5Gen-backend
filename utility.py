Differentiate our product with an Agile focus: Tailor our solution towards an Agile work environment, since this is something that the current copilot solution lacks. This can include features that reduce time-consuming administrative tasks and cater specifically to Agile ceremonies such as retrospectives and stand-ups.\n\n2. Make the most out of the context window: Ensure that our solution can accumulate knowledge from past meetings and use it to provide valuable insights. This can involve improving the meeting generator to take into account the purpose of the meeting (retro, stand-up, ceremony) and adjust the output accordingly.\n\n3. Create a centralized dashboard: Differentiate our product by developing a central dashboard that allows users to manage and track all their meetings and associated tasks. This will add value by providing a centralized and streamlined experience, which is currently lacking in the copilot solution.\n\n4. Integrate with copilot in the long term: While access to copilot is currently limited, we can consider integrating our solution with copilot in the future. This will require collaboration and co-development with Microsoft, leveraging our strategic partnership, and allowing for a more seamless experience for users.\n\n5. Investigate Telstra-specific needs: Research and analyze Telstra's Agile work environment and identify any specific requirements and pain points that can be addressed by our solution. This will enable us to create a product that is tailored to Telstra's needs and provides a unique value proposition.\n\n6. Gather requirements: Chase up the requirements from the product stakeholders, such as the business and executive teams, to ensure that their needs are considered in the development of the solution.\n\nThese action points address the goal of differentiating our product from copilot and ensuring that it aligns with Telstra's Agile work environment, while also considering the integration possibilities with copilot in the long term."},

Differentiating our product from Copilot\n2. Tailoring our solution towards an Agile work environment\n3. Leveraging Copilot for integration into our ecosystem\n4. Discussing the use of meeting minutes and ticket generation\n5. Designing a centralized dashboard for managing meetings\n\nMinutes:\n1. Steven Yuen began the meeting by emphasizing the need to differentiate our solution from Copilot. He highlighted the gaps in Copilot, such as its lack of integration with Agile work environments. Steven suggested focusing on making our solution Agile-focused and tailoring it towards Telstra's needs.\n2. The discussion revolved around whether to leverage Copilot or build our own solution. Jason Hong proposed integrating Copilot into our ecosystem in the long term, but Steven expressed concerns about wasted resources if we eventually migrate to Copilot. The group acknowledged the strategic partnership with Copilot and the possibility of collaborating to integrate our solution.\n3. The group agreed that a centralized dashboard would be a valuable feature, allowing for a seamless transition between meetings and providing a consistent timeline. The need to address Telstra's specific requirements and challenges with Agile meetings was emphasized.\n4. Steven mentioned the potential value of meeting minutes and retrospectives for Telstra employees, but Chris Qu highlighted that retrospectives might not be well-received by team members. David Gailey suggested focusing on the usefulness of a centralized dashboard and improving the employee experience.\n5. Steven expressed his intention to research Agile methodologies and the design of a centralized dashboard. He requested input from the team on potential solutions and committed to balancing existing work with the new requirements.\n\nNext Steps:\n1. Steven will conduct research on Agile methodologies and design a solution tailored to Telstra's needs.\n2. Jason and Chris will continue their current work while remaining open to potential changes based on the research findings.\n3. David will assist in gathering specific requirements and will communicate with external stakeholders.\n\nAction Items:\n1. Steven will follow up to obtain requirements files.\n2. The team will reconvene for further discussion and updates on progress.\n\nMeeting Conclusion:\nThe meeting concluded with Steven confirming that he would reach out for requirements and updates. The team agreed to continue working on their tasks while remaining flexible to include any changes based on the research findings.\n\nMeeting End Time: 3.00 PM"},
