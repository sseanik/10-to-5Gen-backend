    print(ticket_splitter("JIRA Tickets:\n\nTicket 1:\nTitle: Improve Agile Work Environment Integration\nDescription: This ticket involves enhancing our solution to be better aligned with Telstra's Agile work environment. We need to identify and address the gaps in Copilot's integration with Agile processes. By focusing on agility, we can differentiate our product and provide more value to Telstra. This ticket will involve researching Agile methodologies and adapting our solution to cater to Telstra's specific needs.\nAssignee: Yuen, Steven\nPriority: High\n\nTicket 2:\nTitle: Enhance Context Window in Meeting Transcripts\nDescription: Currently, Copilot does not utilize the full context window of meeting transcripts to generate outputs. This ticket involves optimizing our solution to accumulate and leverage knowledge from past meetings. By using the entire context window, we can provide more accurate and relevant outputs to Telstra. This ticket will require modifying our algorithm and analyzing the feasibility of incorporating past meeting data.\nAssignee: Yuen, Steven\nPriority: Medium\n\nTicket 3:\nTitle: Develop Centralized Dashboard for Meeting Management\nDescription: To further differentiate our product from Copilot, we will create a centralized dashboard for managing all meetings. This ticket involves designing and implementing a user-friendly dashboard that allows Telstra users to seamlessly navigate and track their meetings. The dashboard should integrate with our solution and provide a clear overview of meeting details, actions, and outcomes. This feature will enhance the user experience and improve efficiency in meeting management.\nAssignee: Yuen, Steven\nPriority: High\n\nTicket 4:\nTitle: Tailor Meeting Minutes to Agile Ceremonies\nDescription: To cater to Telstra's Agile work environment, we need to modify our meeting minutes generation feature to align with different Agile ceremonies such as retrospectives and stand-ups. This ticket involves understanding the requirements and expectations of each Agile ceremony and adapting our solution to generate meeting minutes that provide meaningful insights and support effective decision-making. This feature will enhance the value of our solution for Telstra teams.\nAssignee: Yuen, Steven\nPriority: Medium\n\nTicket 5:\nTitle: Investigate Access to Copilot and Integration Possibilities\nDescription: Currently, access to Copilot is limited, and we need to understand the possibilities of integrating our solution with the existing Copilot platform. This ticket involves researching Copilot's capabilities, evaluating the feasibility of our integration, and understanding the partnership agreement with Microsoft. The findings from this investigation will inform our long-term strategy and determine the optimal approach for collaboration and integration with Copilot.\nAssignee: Gailey, David\nPriority: High"))
